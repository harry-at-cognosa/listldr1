# ECM AP 10 Template — Section-by-Section Comparison, Sections 5–8 (CHE vs USA)

**CHE file:** `ECM AP 10 KERAMIK MIT WAB VIEW E.docx` — sections 5, 6, 7, 8
**USA file:** `ECM AP 10 Ceramic MIT WAB VIEW_US_FCA Muttenz_11 2025.docx` — sections 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

Section numbering shifts in the USA template because two new sections are inserted. The mapping is:

| CHE section | USA section | Title |
|:-----------:|:-----------:|-------|
| 5 | 5 | Motor Starter Cabinet |
| *(none)* | 6 | Grinding Media (new) |
| *(none)* | 7 | Onsite Services (new) |
| 6 | 8 | Price Summary |
| 7 | 9 | Options and Accessories |
| 8 | 10 | Terms of Delivery |

## Section 5 — Motor Starter Cabinet MSC-WAB VIEW

Both templates use the same section title: "Motor Starter Cabinet MSC-WAB VIEW".

### 5.1 Cabinet Specification

| CHE (ECM AP 10 KERAMIK) | USA (ECM AP 10 Ceramic) |
|---|---|
| **Important remark:** The motor starter cabinet has to be mounted outside of the explosion hazardous area. The motor starter cabinet is delivered without cable connection to the DYNO-MILL and the product pump. | The motor starter cabinet has to be mounted outside of the explosion hazardous area. |
| **Protection:** IP 55 (acc. IEC 60529) | *(protection rating removed — no explicit NEMA rating either)* |
| **PLC controller Siemens S7** with the necessary in- and output cards and software | **PLC controller Siemens S7** with the necessary in- and output cards and software |
| Inside completely wired for connection to **3 x 400 V, 50 Hz** | Inside completely wired for connection to **3 x 460 V, 60 Hz** |
| Prefuses | Prefuses |
| **Transformer 400/230V for power supply of the mill control with 230 VAC / 24 VDC** | **24 V DC power supply** for control voltage |
| Main switch | Main switch |
| Contactor for the mill motor | Contactor for the mill motor |
| Contactor for the product pump solenoid valve | Contactor for the product pump solenoid valve |
| Contactor for the rinsing liquid pump motor | Contactor for the rinsing liquid pump motor |
| Frequency converter for the mill motor | Frequency converter for the mill motor |
| Relays for safety and control instruments | Relays for safety and control instruments |
| Ethernet port | Ethernet port |
| Housing of painted sheet steel (grey) | Housing of painted sheet steel (grey) |
| *(cable note at top)* | The motor starter cabinet is delivered without cable connection to the DYNO-MILL and the product pump. *(moved to bottom)* |

**Difference: Modest** — Compared to UBM, the ECM cabinet changes are less dramatic:
- Voltage/frequency changed (400V/50Hz→460V/60Hz).
- IP 55 protection removed but no NEMA rating added (unlike UBM which added NEMA 12).
- Transformer replaced by 24V DC power supply (same as UBM).
- "Important remark" label removed; cable-connection note moved to bottom.
- PLC (Siemens S7), all contactors, Ethernet port, and housing description remain unchanged.
- No automation vendor line added (unlike UBM which added "Siemens / Allen Bradley automation, or similar per vendor").

ECM retains more of the CHE cabinet spec because it uses a PLC-based WAB VIEW control system vs UBM's simpler WAB BASIC setup.

## Price Summary — CHE section 6 vs USA section 8

ECM has two material execution variants (zirconium oxide and silicon carbide), so the Price Summary has two separate tables.

### 6.1 Execution Zirconium Oxide

| CHE Section 6 (ECM AP 10 KERAMIK) | USA Section 8 (ECM AP 10 Ceramic) |
|---|---|
| 3 – Machine Execution: CHF 242'730.00 | 3 – Machine Execution: USD 404,324.00 |

| *(not present)* | **(*) Sales tax may apply, please provide tax exempt certificate if applicable** |

**Difference: Major** — Same structural expansion as UBM: 4 new line items (Transportation, Grinding Media, Onsite Services, Options), sales tax disclaimer. CHE has 6 rows per variant; USA has 10 rows per variant. USA totals are placeholders.

### 6.3 Price Factor Analysis (ECM Price Summary)

| Line Item | CHE (CHF) | USA (USD) | Factor |
|:----------|----------:|----------:|:------:|
| Machine Execution (ZrO₂) | 242,730 | 404,324 | 1.666× |
| Machine Execution (SiC) | 209,030 | 347,236 | 1.661× |
| Product Pump | 11,066 | 18,746 | 1.694× |
| Motor Starter Cabinet | 41,490 | 70,284 | 1.694× |
| Subtotal (ZrO₂) | 295,286 | 493,354 | 1.671× |
| Subtotal (SiC) | 261,586 | 436,266 | 1.668× |
| Packing | 1,650 | 2,145 | **1.300×** |

The Machine Execution price factors for ECM (~1.66×) are notably lower than UBM (~1.694×). Product Pump and Motor Starter Cabinet use the same 1.694× as UBM. Packing is 1.300× for both.

## Options and Accessories — CHE section 7 vs USA section 9

### 7.1 Header Note

| CHE Section 7 (ECM AP 10 KERAMIK) | USA Section 9 (ECM AP 10 Ceramic) |
|---|---|
| (not included in the total price) | (not included in the total price) |

**Difference: Minor** — Identical text (unlike UBM which capitalised "Not").

---

### 7.2 Spare and Replacement Parts

CHE has a flat list. USA organises the same items under subsection "9.1 Spare and Replacement Parts".

| Item | CHE (CHF) | USA (USD) | Factor |
|------|----------:|----------:|:------:|
| Cylinder screen 0.03 mm (Art. 246550) | 890.00 | 2,522.00 | 2.834× |
| Cylinder screen 0.07 mm (Art. 235210) | 890.00 | 2,522.00 | 2.834× |
| Cylinder screen 0.13 mm (Art. 235212) | 890.00 | 2,522.00 | 2.834× |
| Cylinder screen 0.25 mm (Art. 235214) *(incl. in sec 3)* | 890.00 | 2,522.00 | 2.834× |
| Cylinder screen 0.40 mm (Art. 235216) | 890.00 | 2,522.00 | 2.834× |
| Cooling water multi sensor | 2,440.00 | 6,915.00 | 2.834× |

**Difference: Modest** — All item descriptions identical. Currency CHF→USD. Price factor is a consistent **~2.834×** — identical to UBM spare parts factor. This confirms the accessories/spare-parts pricing uses a different multiplier combination from equipment pricing.

---

### 7.3 Audit Trail / FDA Option

| CHE Section 7 (ECM AP 10 KERAMIK) | USA Section 9 (ECM AP 10 Ceramic) |
|---|---|
| 1× Audit Trail on HMI — FDA 21 CFR Part 11 User Management — Extra charge: **CHF 4'270.00** | *(not present in USA)* |

**Difference: Major** — The Audit Trail / FDA 21 CFR Part 11 option is present in CHE but absent in USA. This is the reverse of the usual pattern (USA typically has more regulatory items). Possibly omitted because the USA WAB VIEW unit (downgraded from Pro in section 3.4) doesn't support this feature, or it may have been rolled into the base specification differently.

---

### 7.4 Documentation (USA only)

This subsection does not exist in the CHE template. Content is identical to UBM.

| CHE (ECM AP 10 KERAMIK) | USA (ECM AP 10 Ceramic) — 9.2 Documentation (*) |
|---|---|
| *(not present)* | 1× IQ+OQ qualification documents: USD 7,930.00 |
| *(not present)* | 1× FAT qualification documents, with realization by WAB, incl. measuring and calibration of instruments: USD 12,560.00 |
| *(not present)* | 1× SAT qualification documents (without realization by WAB): USD 7,130.00 |
| | (*) These options may add time to the delivery |

**Difference: Major (new subsection)** — Identical to UBM. Documentation subsection is product-line-independent. Prices are the same as UBM (7,930 / 12,560 / 7,130).

---

### 7.5 Alternate Product Pump

Unlike UBM (which has an alternate pump subsection 9.3), the ECM USA template has **no alternate product pump subsection**.

| CHE (ECM AP 10 KERAMIK) | USA (ECM AP 10 Ceramic) |
|---|---|
| *(not present)* | *(not present)* |

**Difference: None** — Neither CHE nor USA ECM templates include an alternate pump option. This makes sense because the ECM uses a pneumatic membrane pump (DM 2500) which has no gear-pump alternative. This is a product-line-specific difference.

---

## Terms of Delivery — CHE section 8 vs USA section 10

### 8.1 Row-by-Row Comparison

| Field | CHE Section 8 (ECM AP 10 KERAMIK) | USA Section 10 (ECM AP 10 Ceramic) |

**Difference: Major** — Almost identical to UBM Terms of Delivery changes, with one notable exception:
- **ECM payment split is 40/50/10** (vs UBM's 40/40/20). This is a product-line-specific difference in payment terms, likely reflecting the higher value of ECM equipment.
- All other changes (quotation scope, bank, lead time, customer services, start-up, validity, delivery terms, disclaimer, origin, footer) are identical to UBM.

## Cross-Product Comparison: ECM vs UBM (Sections 5–8)

| Pattern | UBM | ECM | Same? |
|:--------|:---|:---|:---:|
| Motor Starter Cabinet: voltage change | 400V→460V | 400V→460V | yes |
| Motor Starter Cabinet: IP 55 removed | yes, NEMA 12 added | yes, nothing added | **~no** |
| Motor Starter Cabinet: contactors removed | mill + pump contactors removed | all contactors retained | **no** |
| Motor Starter Cabinet: automation vendor added | "Siemens / Allen Bradley" | not added (already has Siemens S7 PLC) | **no** |
| Grinding Media section content | identical | identical | yes |

### Key Findings (Sections 5–8)

1. **Grinding Media, Onsite Services, and Documentation** are fully product-line-independent — identical content and pricing in both UBM and ECM.

2. **Terms of Delivery** is almost product-line-independent, except for the **payment split** (40/40/20 for UBM vs 40/50/10 for ECM). All other fields are identical.

3. **Motor Starter Cabinet** is product-line-specific — ECM retains its PLC and all contactors while UBM removes contactors and adds an automation vendor line. This reflects the different control architectures (ECM: WAB VIEW with Siemens S7 PLC; UBM: WAB BASIC without PLC).

4. **Three distinct price factors** confirmed across both product lines:
   - **~1.694×** for equipment (Motor Starter Cabinet, Product Pump) — consistent across UBM and ECM
   - **~1.300×** for packing — consistent across both
   - **~2.834×** for spare parts/accessories — consistent across both
   - **~1.66×** for ECM Machine Execution only — lower than UBM's 1.694×, suggesting a product-line-specific factor adjustment or manual override

5. **Audit Trail / FDA option** exists only in ECM CHE and is removed in ECM USA — this is the only item that disappears from CHE to USA (all other CHE items are either retained or transformed).
