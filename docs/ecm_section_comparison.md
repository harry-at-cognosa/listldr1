## Section 2 — General Technical Data

### 2.1 Conformity — Left Side (Labels)

| CHE (ECM AP 10 KERAMIK) | USA (ECM AP 10 Ceramic) |

**Difference: Major** — Identical pattern to UBM: CHE has three rows with EU/ATEX declarations. USA collapses to a single row with US classification options. Unlike UBM (which had a question mark), the ECM USA version lists both options without a question mark ("General purpose/not rated" and "Rated area/Class I/Div I") suggesting two configuration choices.

### 3.4 Sensors and Control Unit

| CHE (ECM AP 10 KERAMIK) | USA (ECM AP 10 Ceramic) |
|---|---|
| 1× **Explosion protection of sensors according Directive 2014/34/EU** concerning equipment and protective systems intended for use in potentially explosive atmospheres — **II 2 G Ex ia/ib IIC T4-T6 Gb** | *(entire row removed)* |

### 3.6 Price — Machine Execution

ECM has two price lines (zirconium oxide and silicon carbide variants):

| CHE (ECM AP 10 KERAMIK) | USA (ECM AP 10 Ceramic) |
|---|---|
| Price Machine Execution zirconium oxide: **CHF 242'730.00** | Price Machine Execution zirconium oxide: **USD 404,324.00** |

### Key Findings

1. **Most changes are generic** across product lines — the same text edits, ATEX removal, motor-spec transformations, unit conversions, and UL disclaimer apply to both UBM and ECM.

2. **Product-line-specific differences** exist in:
   - **Page size**: UBM changes A4→Letter; ECM stays A4.
   - **Control unit**: UBM has WAB BASIC (simple); ECM has WAB VIEW Pro→VIEW (significant downgrade with HW/SW spec removal).
   - **Pump type**: UBM has a gear pump (extensive spec changes); ECM has a pneumatic membrane pump (specs nearly identical, only ATEX removed).
   - **Machine Execution price factor**: UBM ~1.694×; ECM ~1.661–1.666× (suggesting multiplier selection may depend on product line or section content).

3. **Section 4 Product Pump price factor** is ~1.694× for both product lines, while Section 3 Machine Execution factors diverge. This may indicate the price factor formula applies differently to higher-value sections or that manual adjustments were made.
