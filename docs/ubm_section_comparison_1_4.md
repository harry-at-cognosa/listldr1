### Patterns Observed

1. **ATEX removal** is the single most pervasive change across sections 3 and 4. Every ATEX/Ex classification is stripped in the USA version. This is systematic and product-line-independent.
2. **Motor specs** follow a consistent transformation: kW→HP(kW), 400V→460V, 50Hz→60Hz, min⁻¹→rpm, ATEX enclosure→TEFC.
3. **Units** shift to imperial-primary with metric in parentheses for dimensions and weight (section 2) but remain metric-only for technical specs (pressure in bar, temperature in °C, flow in l/h).
4. **Price factor** is consistent: both section 3 and section 4 prices show a ~1.694× multiplier (CHF → USD), suggesting the conversion uses FX × MU = 1.10 × 1.54 ≈ 1.694 or a similar combined factor.
5. **Conformity section** is the only area with unresolved content (question mark in USA template) — this requires external input.
