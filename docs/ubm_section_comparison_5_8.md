# UBM 20 Template — Section-by-Section Comparison, Sections 5–8 (CHE vs USA)

**CHE file:** `UBM 20 FU_FU E.docx` — sections 5, 6, 7, 8
**USA file:** `UBM 20 FCFC_US_FCA Muttenz_11 2025.docx` — sections 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

Section numbering shifts in the USA template because two new sections (Grinding Media, Onsite Services) are inserted. The mapping is:

| CHE section | USA section | Title |
|:-----------:|:-----------:|-------|
| 5 | 5 | Motor Starter Cabinet |
| *(none)* | 6 | Grinding Media (new) |
| *(none)* | 7 | Onsite Services (new) |
| 6 | 8 | Price Summary |
| 7 | 9 | Options and Accessories |
| 8 | 10 | Terms of Delivery |

## Section 5 — Motor Starter Cabinet MSC-FC/FC

Both templates use the same section title: "Motor Starter Cabinet MSC-FC/FC".

### 5.1 Cabinet Specification

| CHE (UBM 20 FU\_FU) | USA (UBM 20 FCFC) |
|---|---|
| **Important remark:** The motor starter cabinet has to be mounted outside of the explosion hazardous area. The motor starter cabinet is delivered without cable connection to the DYNO-MILL and the product pump. | Motor starter cabinet to be mounted beside the DYNO-MILL / outside of the hazardous area, including: |
| **Protection:** IP 55 (acc. IEC 60529) | *(protection rating removed)* |
| Inside completely wired for connection to **3 x 400 V, 50 Hz** | Inside completely wired for connection to **460 V AC, 60 Hz, 3 phase** |
| Prefuses | Prefuses |
| **Transformer 400 V/24 VDC** for control voltage | **24 V DC power supply** for control voltage |
| Main switch | Main switch |
| **Current transformer for ammeter** | *(removed)* |
| Contactor for the mill motor | *(removed — mill motor handled by frequency converter)* |
| Contactor for the pump motor | *(removed — pump motor handled by frequency converter)* |
| Contactor for the rinsing liquid pump motor | Contactor for the rinsing liquid pump motor |
| Frequency converter for the mill motor | Frequency converter for the mill motor |
| Frequency converter for the product pump motor | Frequency converter for the product pump motor |
| Time counter | Time counter |
| Relays for safety and control instruments | Relays for safety and control instruments |
| *(not present)* | **Siemens / Allen Bradley automation, or similar per vendor** |
| Housing of painted sheet steel (grey) | **NEMA 12** housing of painted **in** grey |
| *(cable note at top)* | The motor starter cabinet is delivered without cable connection to the DYNO-MILL and the product pump. *(moved to bottom)* |

**Difference: Major** — Voltage/frequency changed (400V/50Hz→460V/60Hz). IP 55 protection rating removed, replaced by NEMA 12 housing standard. Transformer replaced by DC power supply. Current transformer for ammeter removed (consistent with ammeter moving to digital display in section 3.4). Mill and pump motor contactors removed. Siemens/Allen Bradley automation line added. Text restructured: "Important remark" label removed, cable-connection note moved to bottom. Opening sentence rephrased.

### 5.2 Price — Motor Starter Cabinet

| CHE (UBM 20 FU\_FU) | USA (UBM 20 FCFC) |
|---|---|
| Price Motor Starter Cabinet: **CHF 27'260.00** | Price Motor Starter Cabinet: **USD 46,178.00** |

**Difference: Major** — Currency CHF→USD. Factor: 46,178 / 27,260 ≈ **1.694×** (matches sections 3 and 4 exactly).

---

## Section 6 — Grinding Media (USA only)

This section does not exist in the CHE template. It is entirely new in the USA version.

| CHE (UBM 20 FU\_FU) | USA (UBM 20 FCFC) |
|---|---|
| *(section does not exist)* | **6 – Grinding Media** |
| | 1× High strength and wear resistant yttria-stabilized zirconia beads, for fine grinding applications with controlled particle size reduction — 0.6 mm Zirmil Y, quantity 60 kg (screen 0.25 mm) |
| | Price Grinding Media: USD x,xxx.00 *(placeholder)* |

**Difference: Major (new section)** — Entirely new USA-only section. Price is a placeholder (x,xxx.00), suggesting it is filled in per-quote. Content specifies grinding media type and quantity.

---

## Section 7 — Onsite Services (USA only)

This section does not exist in the CHE template. It is entirely new in the USA version.

Note: The section header uses a `Heading 1` paragraph style rather than the standard single-row table header pattern, which is an inconsistency in the USA template.

| CHE (UBM 20 FU\_FU) | USA (UBM 20 FCFC) |
|---|---|
| *(section does not exist)* | **7 – Onsite Services** |
| | 1× Two-day onsite startup and commissioning service, including: |

| | - Travel expenses, per diem, transportation & accommodation |
| | Price Onsite Services (*): USD x,xxx.00 *(placeholder)* |
| | (*) Please confirm dates with WAB at least 2 weeks prior to execution of site visit |

**Difference: Major (new section)** — Entirely new USA-only section. Two-day onsite service with startup/training at no charge, travel costs billed separately. Price is a placeholder.

| Packing, incl. wooden case: CHF 1'650.00 | Packing, incl. wooden case: USD 2,145.00 |
| **TOTAL PRICE, FCA Muttenz, packed: CHF 127'220.00** | **TOTAL PRICE, FCA Muttenz, packed: USD xxx,xxx.00** |
| *(not present)* | **(*) Sales tax may apply, please provide tax exempt certificate if applicable** |

**Difference: Major** — Structure expanded significantly:
- USA adds 4 new line items: Transportation from Muttenz (blank), Grinding Media, Onsite Services, Options and Accessories (all placeholders).
- CHE has 7 rows (including blank), USA has 10 rows.
- Machine subtotal factor: 212,716 / 125,570 ≈ **1.694×**.
- Packing factor: 2,145 / 1,650 ≈ **1.300×** (appears to use only the MU multiplier of 1.30, not the full FX×MU).
- USA total is a placeholder (xxx,xxx.00) since several line items are unfilled.
- Sales tax disclaimer added.

## Options and Accessories — CHE section 7 vs USA section 9

### 7.1 Header Note

| CHE Section 7 (UBM 20 FU\_FU) | USA Section 9 (UBM 20 FCFC) |
|---|---|
| (not included in the total price) | (Not included in the total price) |

**Difference: Minor** — Capitalisation of "Not".

---

### 7.2 Spare and Replacement Parts

CHE has a flat list. USA organises the same items under subsection "9.1 Spare and Replacement Parts".

| Item | CHE (CHF) | USA (USD) | Factor |
|------|----------:|----------:|:------:|
| WAB cylindrical slot screen 0.07 mm (art. 252159) | 2'740.00 | 7,765.00 | 2.834× |
| WAB cylindrical slot screen 0.13 mm (art. 250918) | 2'740.00 | 7,765.00 | 2.834× |
| WAB cylindrical slot screen 0.25 mm (art. 250916) *(incl. in sec 3)* | 2'740.00 | 7,765.00 | 2.834× |
| WAB cylindrical slot screen 0.40 mm (art. 250914) | 2'740.00 | 7,765.00 | 2.834× |
| WAB cylindrical slot screen 0.60 mm (art. 250907) | 2'800.00 | 7,935.00 | 2.834× |
| Ball check valve DN 1½" with flange connection | 1'890.00 | 5,356.00 | 2.834× |
| Drain cock with screen (extra charge) | 415.00 | 1,176.00 | 2.834× |
| Set of torque wrenches (art. 241106) | 1'030.00 | 2,919.00 | 2.835× |
| Grinding cylinder silicon carbide (extra charge) | 12'890.00 | 36,530.00 | 2.834× |
| O-rings perfluorelastomer→**Perfluor** (extra charge) | 2'145.00 | 6,079.00 | 2.834× |

**Difference: Modest** — All items identical in description (only "perfluorelastomer"→"Perfluor"). Currency CHF→USD. The price factor is a remarkably consistent **~2.834×** across all items — very different from the ~1.694× factor used in sections 3-5. This suggests Options/Accessories use a different multiplier combination, possibly FX multiplier_2 × MU multiplier_1 = 1.54 × 1.84 ≈ 2.834, or some other combination of the available factors.
